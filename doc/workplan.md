# Workplan for development

## Setup and simple intro

 1. Create a simple home page @ http://biomatcher.org which is also an
    alias of http://biomatcher.org/index.php, 
    http://biomatcher.org/pages/view, and
    http://biomatcher.org/pages/view/home **DONE**
 2. Create a login and register link on the homepage
 3. Allow the user to register a username and password, saving to the
    `users` table in the biomatcher database
 4. Allow the user to log in, saving a cookie to the browser
 5. If the user is logged in, show the username, rather than
 `login/register`
